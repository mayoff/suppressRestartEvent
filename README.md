This project creates a command-line program named `suppressRestartEvent`. The program installs an event tap that detects and suppresses the event generated by the key combination Command-Control-Eject, which triggers an orderly system restart.

To use it:

1. Build the project.
2. Copy the product (`suppressRestartEvent`) to some stable location.
3. Change the value of the `Program` key in `com.dqd.suppressRestartEvent.plist` to the absolute path of that copy.
4. Copy the modified `com.dqd.suppressRestartEvent.plist` to `$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents`.
5. Run `launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.dqd.suppressRestartEvent.plist` (or reboot).
